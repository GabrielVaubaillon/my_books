# Scripts for my book list

## Issues

- random.py don't respect -n when --markdown
- md to csv need update
- use normpath to get rid of .. in paths
- add location in books
- in stats: soit non_lus => et non lus

## Ideas

(ideas for complete repo, not only scripts)
- add some args to all scripts
    - replace hardcoded values by defaults
- Uses the help from the script to auto-generate the description section of this readme
- translate main README to english
    - would probably also need to translates stats
- use mermaid to do some graphs for stats
- add no-git argument to update.py
    - no-commit
    - no-push
- links to relevant files from stats section
- Lent books
    - add a date
    - sublist with duration
- md to text (print as ascii table
- add internal situation representation (Ebook -> ebook, Ebook (Kobo) -> ebook)
- versus
    - show two books, choose your favorite
    - combine with sorting algorithm (don't need to do every combination)
    - store results
    - BAM you know your favorites, in order
    - to be easy, can maybe ask a few a day
    - can use a GUI
    - add an option dfr for the choices (don't fucking remember)
- tags
    - add tags #tag in Notes
    - can be used to handle differently (genres? int√©grales?)
- GUI?
    - to add new books: doable/easy
    - to modify list by setting to Lu? harder, because search needed
- add dates
    - when did I read the book, how much time it took me?
- check if samish author already exist in file, ask if typo if seems possible
- file with last modifs, last 10 books in collection, last read
